# integrated-healthcare-platform
This project was developed for a hackathon to make outpatient care easy by allowing doctor searches, bookings of home visits, video consultations, and lab test appointments. Users are able to make health profiles, view lab reports, and receive teleconsultations along with chat assistance. It is developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
